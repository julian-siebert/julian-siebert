# About me
I'm a 16 year old German student and software developer.
In my freetime I invent programming languages like [Crash](https://github.com/crash-lang) or
help others with their projects. As you can see in my activity below, I prefer programming the
backend part, of any software. 

Since I despise complicated things that could be more user-friendly, 
I avoid coding in C/C++. Instead, I prefer Rust or any language that allows you to code what you really need without jeopardizing your sanity.
That's why I've started creating my own programming language Crash.
I initially began programming in Java, but there were a few aspects of the language that I absolutely detested. 
Unfortunately, I couldn't find a similar alternative. Therefore, 
Crash aims to address everything I disliked about Java and incorporate all the aspects I love from other popular languages.
Feel free to try it out, when the compiler is finished for compiling some code.

Some projects of mine can be found on [Zyonic Gitlab](https://gitlab.zyonicsoftware.com/julian-siebert).

# Contact & Links
